# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions 😄🎄

Welcome to my repository for the Advent of Code 2023! Advent of Code is an annual coding event where participants are given a series of programming puzzles to solve every day from December 1st to December 25th. Each puzzle comes in two parts and is designed to be solvable by anyone with programming experience. More about the event can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

## 🌟 My Progress

Here's how I'm doing so far:

- [ ] Day 1: Puzzle 1
- [ ] Day 1: Puzzle 2
- [ ] Day 2: Puzzle 1
- [ ] Day 2: Puzzle 2
- [ ] Day 3: Puzzle 1
- [ ] Day 3: Puzzle 2

## 🧠 Approach

For each puzzle, I'm using a mix of problem-solving techniques and coding strategies. My solutions are primarily written in python, leveraging algorithms, data structures, and sometimes a bit of creative thinking!

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each day's puzzles are organized in separate folders. Inside each folder, my solution code, any input data provided by the event organizers and some outputs that have been helpful to solve the problem.
